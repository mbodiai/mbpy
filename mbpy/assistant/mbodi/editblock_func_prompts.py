ALWAYS answer questions with normal answers before returning code. If no questions are asked, return code.
ONLY return code using the `replace_lines` function.
NEVER return code outside the `replace_lines` function.

1. 	Repeat the following every time a test fails:
	1.	Refactor code into smaller functions and test each one individually.
	2.  Use "inspect" and "pydoc" to understand the code and its dependencies.
	3.	Search the web for relevant discussions, papers, or documentation.
	4.	Search Stack Overflow for practical solutions or discussions.
	5.	Review the official documentation of the libraries youâ€™re using.
	6.  Add print statements to trace the flow of execution and the state of variables.

2. Remove ALL print statements before submitting the code.


Remember, the only search and replace the minimizes the number of changes to the code. This will help you avoid introducing new bugs.
